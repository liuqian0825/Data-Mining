This code is the source code of ¡¶Fast algorithm for detecting community structure in networks¡·. 
main.m is the main function.It load the datasets.
FastNewman.m is the loop of the community detection.
GetModularity.m is the function to get the modularity of the graph.
We use the matlab function dendrogram to draw the graph.
Finally, we can see that the datasets are cut in four communitys.
